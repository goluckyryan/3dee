the 3Dee is already complied. 

to run:

$./threedee infile

the normal output massage is:

    STOP  *** DETECTED K.E. L.E. ZERO ,NORMAL EXIT *** statement executed

the output file is outfile

the make_infile.cpp can generate infile from replacing some value from infile.temp

the read_out.cpp can read the cross sectio (inculding PWIA, DWIA) and Analysing power (A00n0)
it will save the reading in test.txt

the 3DeeGee.cpp can generate 2D data, whihc combined the make_infile.cpp and read_out.cpp with some modification. 
  ---notics that 3Dee is in Nucleus frame
  
the 3knockout.cpp combined the knockout.cpp with 3DeeGee.cpp
  ---this is in lab frame
